# üö® RESOLVE GIT CONFLICT NOW - EXACT COMMANDS

## Current Status (from git status):
- ‚úÖ `wsgi.py` is staged (ready to commit)
- ‚ùå `passenger_wsgi.py` has merge conflict ("both modified")
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è `tmp/` directory is untracked (ignore this)

## EXACT COMMANDS TO RUN RIGHT NOW:

### Step 1: Resolve the passenger_wsgi.py conflict
```bash
git checkout --ours passenger_wsgi.py
```

### Step 2: Stage the resolved file
```bash
git add passenger_wsgi.py
```

### Step 3: Complete the merge commit
```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict: keep clean passenger_wsgi.py without recursion"
```

### Step 4: Test the fixed file
```bash
python3 passenger_wsgi.py
```
**Expected**: Should run quietly with no output (that means SUCCESS!)

### Step 5: Restart your application
```bash
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

### Step 6: Test your API
```bash
curl -I http://aeconlineshop.com/api/health
```

## What Each Command Does:
1. `git checkout --ours` = Keep YOUR version (the clean one)
2. `git add` = Mark the conflict as resolved
3. `git commit` = Complete the merge
4. `python3 passenger_wsgi.py` = Test for recursion errors
5. `touch tmp/restart.txt` = Restart the web app
6. `curl` = Test if API is working

## Expected Results:
- No more RecursionError
- No more "address already in use" 
- Your API will be live at http://aeconlineshop.com/api/
