# üö® EMERGENCY FIX: Recursive Loop Resolved

## Problem Identified
The `passenger_wsgi.py` file had a git merge conflict between:
- ‚úÖ **Clean version** (lines 1-26): Direct FastAPI import
- ‚ùå **Old recursive version**: Self-importing loop

## Immediate Solution

### Step 1: Resolve Git Conflict
```bash
# You're currently in a git merge conflict state
# Let's resolve it by keeping the clean version

# Remove the conflicted file and use the clean version
git checkout --ours passenger_wsgi.py
git add passenger_wsgi.py
git commit -m "Fix: Use clean passenger_wsgi.py without recursive imports"
```

### Step 2: Test the Fixed File
```bash
# Test the clean passenger_wsgi.py
python3 passenger_wsgi.py
# Should run quietly without errors
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
# Restart the application
touch tmp/restart.txt
```

## Root Cause
The recursive error happened because an old version of `passenger_wsgi.py` contained:
```python
wsgi = imp.load_source('wsgi', 'passenger_wsgi.py')  # ‚ùå RECURSIVE!
```

## Current Clean Version
```python
from product_management import app as application  # ‚úÖ DIRECT IMPORT
```

## Next Steps
1. Resolve git conflict (Step 1 above)
2. Test the file (Step 2 above)  
3. Restart application (Step 3 above)
4. Test your API endpoints

Your FastAPI is working perfectly in the virtual environment - we just need to fix this git conflict!
