## Possible Causes

### 1. Deployment Not Active
- The Railway project may not be deployed
- The deployment may have failed during build/start
- The service may have crashed after starting

### 2. Configuration Issues
- Wrong startup command in railway.toml
- Missing environment variables
- Database connection issues preventing startup

### 3. URL Issues
- The deployment URL may be different
- The service may be deployed to a different subdomain
- The project may have been renamed

### 4. Build/Runtime Errors
- Python dependencies not installing correctly
- Import errors preventing the app from starting
- Database migration issues

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
- Log into Railway dashboard
- Verify the project exists and is deployed
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify the correct deployment URL

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
Look for these common error patterns:
```
ERROR: Error loading ASGI app
ModuleNotFoundError
ImportError
Database connection failed
Port binding failed
```

### 3. Verify Configuration Files

#### railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[[services]]
name = "web"
source = "."

[services.web]
startCommand = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
```

#### Procfile
```
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### 4. Check Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` (should be automatically provided by Railway PostgreSQL)
- Any custom environment variables your app needs

### 5. Test Local Import
```bash
python test_import.py
python main.py
```

## Deployment Recovery Steps

### Step 1: Redeploy from Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
4. Monitor deployment logs

### Step 2: Check Service Status
1. Verify the service is running
2. Check resource usage (CPU, Memory)
3. Verify port binding

### Step 3: Manual Deployment Trigger
If using GitHub integration:
1. Make a small commit to trigger redeploy
2. Push to the connected branch
3. Monitor deployment process

### Step 4: Alternative Deployment URLs
Try these potential URLs:
- https://web-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
- https://product-management-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
- Check Railway dashboard for the exact URL

## Monitoring Commands

### Test Single Endpoint
```bash
curl -v https://product-management-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Continuous Monitoring
```bash
python monitor_railway_deployment.py --continuous
```

### Check DNS Resolution
```bash
nslookup product-management-production.up.railway.app
```

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. **URGENT**: Review deployment logs for specific error messages
3. **URGENT**: Verify the correct deployment URL
4. Redeploy if necessary
5. Test endpoints after redeployment
6. Set up monitoring alerts for future deployments

## Contact Information

If the issue persists:
- Check Railway documentation
- Contact Railway support
- Review Railway community forums
- Check Railway status page for service outages
