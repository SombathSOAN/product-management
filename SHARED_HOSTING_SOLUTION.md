# Shared Hosting Solution for Product Management API

## Current Situation Analysis
- **Hosting**: Shared hosting with cPanel (aeconlineshop.com)
- **Server**: 192.250.235.86
- **Issue**: Cannot run uvicorn/Python web servers directly on shared hosting
- **Limitations**: No sudo access, port restrictions, process limitations

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Option 1: CGI/WSGI Deployment (Recommended for Shared Hosting)

Most cPanel shared hosting supports Python via CGI or WSGI. Let's set this up:

#### Step 1: Create WSGI Application
```python
# wsgi.py
import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Add your project directory to Python path
project_dir = Path(__file__).parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_dir))

# Import your FastAPI app
from product_management import app

# WSGI adapter for FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.wsgi import WSGIMiddleware
application = WSGIMiddleware(app)
```

#### Step 2: Create .htaccess for URL Routing
```apache
# .htaccess
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ wsgi.py/$1 [QSA,L]
```

### Option 2: Static File Deployment with API Proxy

If WSGI doesn't work, deploy as static files with API calls to external service:

#### Step 1: Build Static Frontend
```bash
# Create static HTML/JS version
python build_static.py
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to public_html
```bash
# Copy files to cPanel public_html
cp -r static/* /home/aeconlin/public_html/
```

### Option 3: Subdomain with Python App

Create a subdomain specifically for your API:

1. **In cPanel**: Create subdomain `api.aeconlineshop.com`
2. **Point to**: `/home/aeconlin/api/`
3. **Deploy**: Python app in subdomain directory

## 🚀 BETTER SOLUTIONS (Recommended)

### Option A: VPS Migration (Best Performance)
**Providers**: DigitalOcean ($6/month), Vultr ($6/month), Linode ($5/month)

**Benefits**:
- Full sudo access
- Any port (80, 443, 8000, etc.)
- Custom domains
- SSL certificates
- Process control
- Database control

### Option B: Platform-as-a-Service (Easiest)
**Providers**: Railway, Render, Heroku, Vercel

**Benefits**:
- Zero server management
- Automatic deployments
- Built-in databases
- SSL included
- Custom domains

## 📋 MIGRATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Quick Test (Today)
1. Try WSGI deployment on current hosting
2. Test basic functionality
3. Identify limitations

### Phase 2: VPS Setup (This Week)
1. Choose VPS provider
2. Set up Ubuntu server
3. Install Python, NGINX, PostgreSQL
4. Deploy full application
5. Configure domain and SSL

### Phase 3: Production (Next Week)
1. Database migration
2. Domain DNS update
3. SSL certificate setup
4. Monitoring and backups

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### For Current Shared Hosting:
```bash
# 1. Create WSGI file
cat > wsgi.py << 'EOF'
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))
from product_management import app
from fastapi.middleware.wsgi import WSGIMiddleware
application = WSGIMiddleware(app)
EOF

# 2. Create .htaccess
cat > .htaccess << 'EOF'
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ wsgi.py/$1 [QSA,L]
EOF

# 3. Test deployment
curl http://aeconlineshop.com/api/health
```

### For VPS Migration:
```bash
# 1. Server setup commands (will provide detailed script)
# 2. Domain configuration
# 3. SSL setup with Let's Encrypt
# 4. Database migration
```

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Immediate**: Try WSGI deployment on current hosting for testing
**Long-term**: Migrate to VPS for full control and better performance

Your Product Management API is too sophisticated for shared hosting limitations. A $6/month VPS will give you:
- 10x better performance
- Full control
- Professional deployment
- Scalability options
